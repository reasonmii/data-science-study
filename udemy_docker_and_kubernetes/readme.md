<b>Why use Docker?</b>
- Docker allows us to distribute a cross-platform, preconfigured image with all the requisite software and correct package versions.
- Once Docker is installed and the container is running, access Jupyter.
- There is no need to install any additional Java or PySpark dependencies as they are all bundled as part of the Docker container.
